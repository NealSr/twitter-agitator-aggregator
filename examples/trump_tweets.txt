Sat Sep 17 21:38:50 +0000 2016 | The failing @nytimes has gone nuts that Crooked Hillary is doing so badly. They are willing to say anything, has become a laughingstock rag!

Sat Sep 17 17:28:43 +0000 2016 | Wacky @NYTimesDowd, who hardly knows me, makes up things that I never said for her boring interviews and column. A neurotic dope!
Sat Sep 17 13:13:43 +0000 2016 | .@CNN just doesn't get it, and that's why their ratings are so low - and getting worse. Boring anti-Trump panelists, mostly losers in life!
Sat Sep 17 11:51:41 +0000 2016 | I never met former Defense Secretary Robert Gates. He knows nothing about me. But look at the results under his guidance - a total disaster!
Sat Sep 17 05:53:09 +0000 2016 | Crooked Hillary wants to take your 2nd Amendment rights away. Will guns be taken from her heavily armed Secret Service detail? Maybe not!

Sun Sep 11 01:14:10 +0000 2016 | The seriously failing @nytimes, despite so much winning and poll numbers that will soon put me in first place, only writes dishonest hits!
Sat Sep 10 23:37:06 +0000 2016 | Hillary Clinton just had her 47% moment. What a terrible thing she said about so many great Americans!
Sat Sep 10 20:46:30 +0000 2016 | RT @BarackObama: RT if you agree: We need a President who is fighting for all Americans, not one who writes off nearly half the country.
Sat Sep 10 18:18:37 +0000 2016 | While Hillary said horrible things about my supporters, and while many of her supporters will never vote for me, I still respect them all!
Sat Sep 10 15:54:27 +0000 2016 | Really sad that Republicans would allow themselves to be used in a Clinton ad. Lindsey Graham, Romney, Flake, Sass. SUPREME COURT, REMEMBER!
Sat Sep 10 12:47:18 +0000 2016 | Wow, Hillary Clinton was SO INSULTING to my supporters, millions of amazing, hard working people. I think it will cost her at the Polls!

Fri Sep 09 14:42:56 +0000 2016 | Jeff Zucker failed @NBC and he is now failing @CNN.
Fri Sep 09 14:37:53 +0000 2016 | .@CNN is unwatchable. Their news on me is fiction. They
are a disgrace to the broadcasting industry and an arm of the Clinton campaign.

Thu Sep 08 16:25:36 +0000 2016 | Hillary Clinton answered email questions differently last night than she has in the past. She is totally confused. Unfit to serve as #POTUS.
Thu Sep 08 15:17:47 +0000 2016 | Hillary just gave a disastrous news conference on the tarmac to make up for poor performance last night. She's being decimated by the media!

Mon Aug 15 01:34:25 +0000 2016 | Certain Republicans who have lost to me would rather save face by fighting me than see the U.S.Supreme Court get proper appointments. Sad!
Mon Aug 15 00:07:43 +0000 2016 | "Stay on message" is the chant. I always do - trade, jobs, military, vets, 2nd A, repeal Ocare, borders, etc - but media misrepresents!
Sun Aug 14 23:57:37 +0000 2016 | I have always been the same person-remain true to self.The media wants me to change but it would be very dishonest to supporters to do so!
Sun Aug 14 17:06:20 +0000 2016 | It is not "freedom of the press" when newspapers and others are allowed to say and write whatever they want even if it is completely false!
Sun Aug 14 16:55:07 +0000 2016 | I am not only fighting Crooked Hillary, I am fighting the dishonest and corrupt media and her government protection process. People get it!
Sun Aug 14 16:50:51 +0000 2016 | Crooked Hillary Clinton is being protected by the media. She is not a talented person or politician. The dishonest media refuses to expose!
Sun Aug 14 12:46:17 +0000 2016 | My rallies are not covered properly by the media. They never discuss the real message and never show crowd size or enthusiasm.
Sun Aug 14 12:37:37 +0000 2016 | If the disgusting and corrupt media covered me honestly and didn't put false meaning into the words I say, I would be beating Hillary by 20%
Sun Aug 14 12:31:23 +0000 2016 | The failing @nytimes, which never spoke to me, keeps saying that I am saying to advisers that I will change. False, I am who I am-never said
Sun Aug 14 12:24:48 +0000 2016 | The failing @nytimes talks about anonymous sources and meetings that never happened. Their reporting is fiction. The media protects Hillary!
Sat Aug 13 20:08:01 +0000 2016 | "@zulu_out: You are a man for the people because you know what it is like to be among the people #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #USA Loves U" Thanks
Sat Aug 13 20:06:38 +0000 2016 | "@PaulaDuvall2: We're all enjoying you, as well, Mr. T.! You've inspired Hope and a Positive Spirit throughout America! God bless you!" Nice
Sat Aug 13 20:03:55 +0000 2016 | "@need2knowu:  @willspeakout yes you are my hero I admire you for laying down your glorious luxurious life to get beat up for America!!!"
Sat Aug 13 20:02:38 +0000 2016 | We now have confirmation as to one reason Crooked H wanted to be sure that nobody saw her e-mails - PAY-FOR-PLAY. How can she run for Pres.
Sat Aug 13 19:39:23 +0000 2016 | "@willspeakout: Thank you for all that you are doing for us! You campaign endlessly and have spent millions.We love you! #TrumpTrain" Thanks
Sat Aug 13 18:39:26 +0000 2016 | I am truly enjoying myself while running for president. The people of our country are amazing - great numbers on November 8th!
Sat Aug 13 18:29:23 +0000 2016 | The failing @nytimes has become a newspaper of fiction. Their stories about me always quote non-existent unnamed sources. Very dishonest!
Sat Aug 13 00:17:38 +0000 2016 | Will be on @seanhannity tonight at 10pm, hosted by @GovMikeHuckabee. Enjoy!

Fri Aug 12 13:01:06 +0000 2016 | ISIS gained tremendous strength during Hillary Clinton's term as Secretary of State. When will the dishonest media report the facts!
Fri Aug 12 11:43:43 +0000 2016 | I love watching these poor, pathetic people (pundits) on television working so hard and so seriously to try and figure me out. They can't!
Fri Aug 12 11:07:51 +0000 2016 | A massive tax increase will be necessary to fund Crooked Hillary Clinton's agenda. What a terrible (and boring) rollout that was yesterday!
Fri Aug 12 10:57:34 +0000 2016 | "@laurencristmann: Thank you for coming to Pennsylvania today. I will be there with @C_Lynne_Ryan your 3rd CD delegate at 2 pm"
Fri Aug 12 10:26:20 +0000 2016 | Ratings challenged @CNN reports so seriously that I call President Obama (and Clinton) "the founder" of ISIS, &amp; MVP. THEY DON'T GET SARCASM?
Fri Aug 12 04:10:25 +0000 2016 | "@EnemyWithinn: @realDonaldTrump @elsolarverde @nytimes People gotta stop believing media lies about Trump." That would indeed be nice!
Fri Aug 12 04:06:22 +0000 2016 | "@elsolarverde: THE CORRUPT MEDIA CREATS CONTROVERSY AGAINST @realDonaldTrump TO AVOID ISSUES ABOUT HillaryClinton https://t.co/RW5UcWLfA8"

Wed Aug 10 02:21:12 +0000 2016 | Media desperate to distract from Clinton's anti-2A stance. I said pro-2A citizens must organize and get out vote to save our Constitution!
Wed Aug 10 01:11:39 +0000 2016 | When is the media going to talk about Hillary's policies that have gotten people killed, like Libya, open borders, and maybe her emails?

Mon Aug 01 22:54:27 +0000 2016 | During the GOP convention, CNN cut away from the victims of illegal immigrant violence. They don‚Äôt want them heard. https://t.co/EHRiLkQDWD
Mon Aug 01 22:52:39 +0000 2016 | When will CNN do a segment on Hillary‚Äôs plan to increase Syrian refugees 550% and how much it will cost?
Mon Aug 01 22:52:00 +0000 2016 | Hillary Clinton raked in money from regimes that horribly oppress women and gays &amp; refuses to speak out against Radical Islam.

Mon Aug 01 18:47:54 +0000 2016 | People believe CNN these days almost as little as they believe Hillary....that's really saying something!
Mon Aug 01 18:46:58 +0000 2016 | The people who support Hillary sit behind CNN anchor chairs, or headline fundraisers - those disconnected from real life.
Mon Aug 01 18:45:22 +0000 2016 | Will CNN send its cameras to the border to show the massive unreported crisis now unfolding -- or are they worried it will hurt Hillary?
Mon Aug 01 18:44:04 +0000 2016 | When will we see stories from CNN on Clinton Foundation corruption and Hillary's pay-for-play at State Department?
Mon Aug 01 18:43:25 +0000 2016 | CNN anchors are completely out of touch with everyday people worried about rising crime, failing schools and vanishing jobs.
Mon Aug 01 18:42:50 +0000 2016 | CNN will soon be the least trusted name in news if they continue to be the press shop for Hillary Clinton.

Mon Aug 01 13:03:02 +0000 2016 | So with all of the Obama tough talk on Russia and the Ukraine, they have already taken Crimea and continue to push. That's what I said!
Mon Aug 01 12:50:32 +0000 2016 | When I said in an interview that Putin is "not going into Ukraine, you can mark it down," I am saying if I am President. Already in Crimea!
Mon Aug 01 11:27:43 +0000 2016 | This story is not about Mr. Khan, who is all over the place doing interviews, but rather RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM and the U.S. Get smart!
Mon Aug 01 11:10:51 +0000 2016 | Mr. Khan, who does not know me, viciously attacked me from the stage of the DNC and is now all over T.V. doing the same - Nice!
Mon Aug 01 00:57:15 +0000 2016 | Wow, it is unbelievable how distorted, one-sided and biased the media is against us. The failing @nytimes is a joke. @CNN is laughable!
Sun Jul 31 20:31:06 +0000 2016 | "@RealJamesWoods:  Without absolutely OWNING the liberal media, HillaryClinton wouldn't stand a chance. #VoterFraud and #MSM her only hope."
Sun Jul 31 20:09:00 +0000 2016 | The dishonest media is fawning over the Democratic Convention. I wonder why, then, my speech had millions of more viewers than Crooked H?
Sun Jul 31 13:32:55 +0000 2016 | I was viciously attacked by Mr. Khan at the Democratic Convention. Am I not allowed to respond? Hillary voted for the Iraq war, not me!
Sun Jul 31 12:57:21 +0000 2016 | Captain Khan, killed 12 years ago, was a hero, but this is about RADICAL ISLAMIC TERROR and the weakness of our "leaders" to eradicate it!
Sun Jul 31 03:32:40 +0000 2016 | Nielson Media Research final numbers on ACCEPTANCE SPEECH: TRUMP  32.2 MILLION.  CLINTON 27.8 MILLION.  Thank you!
Sat Jul 30 23:00:07 +0000 2016 | Thank you to all of the television viewers that made my speech at the Republican National Convention #1 over Crooked Hillary and DEMS.
Sat Jul 30 22:28:22 +0000 2016 | Can you imagine if I had the small crowds that Hillary is drawing today in Pennsylvania. It would be a major media event! @CNN @FoxNews

Sat Jul 30 22:12:36 +0000 2016 | The "Rust Belt" was created by politicians like the Clintons who allowed our jobs to be stolen from us by other countries like Mexico. END!
Sat Jul 30 22:04:14 +0000 2016 | Crooked's stop in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, where jobs have been absolutely decimated by dumb politicians, drew less than 200 - with Bill, VP
Sat Jul 30 21:55:48 +0000 2016 | #CrookedHillary = Obama's third term, which would be terrible news for our economic growth - seen below. https://t.co/y9WJoUaaql
Sat Jul 30 21:51:25 +0000 2016 | Word is that Crooked Hillary has very small and unenthusiastic crowds in Pennsylvania. Perhaps it is because her husband signed NAFTA?
Sat Jul 30 20:01:32 +0000 2016 | I turned down a meeting with Charles and David Koch. Much better for them to meet with the puppets of politics, they will do much better!
Sat Jul 30 19:55:26 +0000 2016 | Why doesn't the media want to report that on the two "Big Thursdays" when Crooked Hillary and I made our speeches - Republican's won ratings
Sat Jul 30 18:34:54 +0000 2016 | #CrookedHillary https://t.co/xyoPFJmByp
Sat Jul 30 18:07:07 +0000 2016 | Crooked Hillary Clinton is soft on crime, supports open borders, and wants massive tax hikes. A formula for disaster!
Sat Jul 30 18:06:17 +0000 2016 | Violent crime is rising across the United States, yet the DNC convention ignored it. Crime reduction will be one of my top priorities.
Sat Jul 30 16:29:17 +0000 2016 | Just got back from Colorado. The love and enthusiasm at two rallies was incredible. Big crowds!

Sat Jul 30 12:54:44 +0000 2016 | Hillary can never win over Bernie supporters. Her foreign wars, 
NAFTA/TPP support &amp; Wall Street ties are driving away millions of votes.

Fri Jul 29 12:40:10 +0000 2016 | The media coverage this morning of the very average Clinton speech and Convention is a joke. @CNN and the little watched @Morning_Joe = SAD!
Fri Jul 29 03:59:04 +0000 2016 | No one has worse judgement than Hillary Clinton - corruption and devastation follows her wherever she goes.
Fri Jul 29 03:57:06 +0000 2016 | Hillary's wars in the Middle East have unleashed destruction, terrorism and ISIS across the world.
Fri Jul 29 03:54:22 +0000 2016 | Hillary's vision is a borderless world where working people have no power, no jobs, no safety.
Fri Jul 29 03:52:46 +0000 2016 | Hillary will never reform Wall Street. She is owned by Wall Street!
Fri Jul 29 03:50:59 +0000 2016 | Our way of life is under threat by Radical Islam and Hillary Clinton cannot even bring herself to say the words.
Fri Jul 29 03:47:56 +0000 2016 | Hillary's refusal to mention Radical Islam, as she pushes a 550% increase in refugees, is more proof that she is unfit to lead the country.

Wed Jul 27 13:01:03 +0000 2016 | Not one American flag on the massive stage at the Democratic National Convention until people started complaining-then a small one. Pathetic
Wed Jul 27 12:57:20 +0000 2016 | Our not very bright Vice President, Joe Biden, just stated that I wanted to "carpet bomb" the enemy. Sorry Joe, that was Ted Cruz!
Wed Jul 27 10:08:35 +0000 2016 | Crooked Hillary Clinton wants to flood our country with Syrian immigrants that we know little or nothing about. The danger is massive. NO!
Wed Jul 27 10:01:39 +0000 2016 | Hopefully the violent and vicious killing by ISIS of a beloved French priest is causing people to start thinking rationally. Get tough!
Wed Jul 27 09:50:55 +0000 2016 | The Democratic Convention has paid ZERO respect to the great police and law enforcement professionals of our country. No recognition - SAD!
Wed Jul 27 09:43:16 +0000 2016 | Funny how the failing @nytimes is pushing Dems narrative that Russia is working for me because Putin said "Trump is a genius." America 1st!
Wed Jul 27 09:33:52 +0000 2016 | As I have been saying, Crooked Hillary will approve the job killing TPP after the election, despite her statements to the contrary: top adv.

Wed Jul 27 02:02:24 +0000 2016 | No matter what Bill Clinton says and no matter how well he says it, the phony media will exclaim it to be incredible. Highly overrated!

Tue Jul 26 22:47:28 +0000 2016 | In order to try and deflect the horror and stupidity of the Wikileakes disaster, the Dems said maybe it is Russia dealing with Trump. Crazy!
Tue Jul 26 19:48:08 +0000 2016 | Dems don't want to talk ISIS b/c Hillary's foreign interventions unleashed ISIS &amp; her refugee plans make it easier for them to come here.

Tue Jul 26 12:34:19 +0000 2016 | Funny, if you listen to @FoxNews, the Democrats did not have a good day. If you listen to the other two, they are fawning. What a difference
Tue Jul 26 03:19:38 +0000 2016 | Bernie Sanders totally sold out to Crooked Hillary Clinton. All of that work, energy and money, and nothing to show for it! Waste of time.
Tue Jul 26 03:12:57 +0000 2016 | Elizabeth Warren, often referred to as Pocahontas, just misrepresented me and spoke glowingly about Crooked Hillary, who she always hated!
Tue Jul 26 03:04:56 +0000 2016 | Sad to watch Bernie Sanders abandon his revolution. We welcome all voters who want to fix our rigged system and bring back our jobs.

Mon Jul 25 21:32:59 +0000 2016 | Clinton betrayed Bernie voters. Kaine supports TPP, is in pocket of Wall Street, and backed Iraq War.

Mon Jul 25 14:05:27 +0000 2016 | Great POLL numbers are coming out all over. People don't want another four years of Obama, and Crooked Hillary would be even worse. #MAGA
Mon Jul 25 14:01:25 +0000 2016 | The State of Florida is so embarrassed by the antics of Crooked Hillary Clinton and Debbie Wasserman Schultz that they will vote for CHANGE!
Mon Jul 25 13:47:45 +0000 2016 | Wow, the Republican Convention went so smoothly compared to the Dems total mess. But fear not, the dishonest media will find a good spinnnn!
Mon Jul 25 13:42:55 +0000 2016 | Here we go again with another Clinton scandal, and e-mails yet (can you believe). Crooked Hillary knew the fix was in, B never had a chance!
Mon Jul 25 13:19:18 +0000 2016 | Crooked Hillary Clinton knew everything that her "servant" was doing at the DNC - they just got caught, that's all! They laughed at Bernie.
Mon Jul 25 12:27:35 +0000 2016 | If Bernie Sanders, after seeing the just released e-mails, continues to look exhausted and done, then his legacy will never be the same.
Mon Jul 25 12:26:56 +0000 2016 | Thank you! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain https://t.co/Pzs9uwgzam
Mon Jul 25 12:02:01 +0000 2016 | Hillary was involved in the e-mail scandal because she is the only one with judgement so bad that such a thing could have happened!
Mon Jul 25 11:57:17 +0000 2016 | How much BAD JUDGEMENT was on display by the people in DNC in writing those really dumb e-mails, using even religion, against Bernie!
Mon Jul 25 11:31:22 +0000 2016 | The new joke in town is that Russia leaked the disastrous DNC e-mails, which should never have been written (stupid), because Putin likes me
Sun Jul 24 23:59:10 +0000 2016 | Watched Crooked Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine on 60 Minutes. No way they are going to fix America's problems. ISIS &amp; all others laughing!
Sun Jul 24 23:47:08 +0000 2016 | The ratings for the Republican National Convention were very good, but for the final night, my speech, great. Thank you!
Sun Jul 24 22:33:42 +0000 2016 | The highly neurotic Debbie Wasserman Schultz is angry that, after stealing and cheating her way to a Crooked Hillary victory, she's out!
Sun Jul 24 22:16:59 +0000 2016 | The Democrats are in a total meltdown but the biased media will say how great they are doing! E-mails say the rigged system is alive &amp; well!
Sun Jul 24 22:07:49 +0000 2016 | Even though Bernie Sanders has lost his energy and his strength, I don't believe that his supporters will let Crooked Hillary off the hook!
Sun Jul 24 22:02:42 +0000 2016 | Crooked Hillary Clinton was not at all loyal to the person in her rigged system that pushed her over the top, DWS. Too bad Bernie flamed out
Sun Jul 24 21:53:29 +0000 2016 | If the Republican Convention had blown up with e-mails, resignation of boss and the beat down of a big player. (Bernie), media would go wild
Sun Jul 24 20:45:31 +0000 2016 | The @CNN panels are so one sided, almost all against Trump. @FoxNews is so much better and the ratings are much higher. Don't watch CNN!
Sun Jul 24 20:30:06 +0000 2016 | I always said that Debbie Wasserman Schultz was overrated. The Dems Convention is cracking up and Bernie is exhausted, no energy left!
Sun Jul 24 20:20:57 +0000 2016 | Today proves what I have always known, that @Reince Priebus is the tough one and the smart one, not Debbie Wasserman Shultz (@DWStweets.)
Sun Jul 24 13:30:59 +0000 2016 | Sorry folks, but Bernie Sanders is exhausted, just can't go on any longer. He is trying to dismiss the new e-mails and DNC disrespect. SAD!
Sun Jul 24 13:27:56 +0000 2016 | There is no longer a Bernie Sanders "political revolution." He is turning out to be a weak and somewhat pathetic figure,wants it all to end!
Sun Jul 24 12:30:15 +0000 2016 | An analysis showed that Bernie Sanders would have won the Democratic nomination if it were not for the Super Delegates.
Sun Jul 24 12:15:51 +0000 2016 | Looks like the Bernie people will fight. If not, their BLOOD, SWEAT AND TEARS was a total waste of time. Kaine stands for opposite!
Sun Jul 24 11:56:43 +0000 2016 | Wow, President Obama's brother, Malik, just announced that he is voting for me. Was probably treated badly by president-like everybody else!
Sun Jul 24 11:25:06 +0000 2016 | Bernie Sanders started off strong, but with the selection of Kaine for V.P., is ending really weak. So much for a movement! TOTAL DISRESPECT
Sun Jul 24 11:16:15 +0000 2016 | The Crooked Hillary V.P. choice is VERY disrespectful to Bernie Sanders and all of his supporters. Just another case of BAD JUDGEMENT by H!

Sat Jul 23 21:20:58 +0000 2016 | The Wikileaks e-mail release today was so bad to Sanders that it will make it impossible for him to support her, unless he is a fraud!
Sat Jul 23 20:43:33 +0000 2016 | Just saw Crooked Hillary and Tim Kaine together. ISIS and our other enemies are drooling. They don't look presidential to me!
Sat Jul 23 16:06:15 +0000 2016 | I will bring jobs back and get wages up. People haven't had a real wage increase in almost twenty years. Clinton killed jobs!
Sat Jul 23 15:36:41 +0000 2016 | Tim Kaine has been praising the Trans Pacific Partnership and has been pushing hard to get it approved. Job killer!
Sat Jul 23 15:01:48 +0000 2016 | Funny that the Democrats would have their convention in Pennsylvania where her husband and her killed so many jobs. I will bring jobs back!
Sat Jul 23 14:51:32 +0000 2016 | Crooked Hillary Clinton has destroyed jobs and manufacturing in Pennsylvania. Against steelworkers and miners. Husband signed NAFTA.
Sat Jul 23 10:55:20 +0000 2016 | Leaked e-mails of DNC show plans to destroy Bernie Sanders. Mock his heritage and much more. On-line from Wikileakes, really vicious. RIGGED
Sat Jul 23 10:42:10 +0000 2016 | Pocahontas wanted V.P. slot so badly but wasn't chosen because she has done nothing in the Senate. Also, Crooked Hillary hates her!
Sat Jul 23 10:35:37 +0000 2016 | Tim Kaine is, and always has been, owned by the banks. Bernie supporters are outraged, was their last choice. Bernie fought for nothing!
Sat Jul 23 10:31:18 +0000 2016 | The Bernie Sanders supporters are furious with the choice of Tim Kaine, who represents the opposite of what Bernie stands for. Philly fight?

Sat Jul 23 03:49:04 +0000 2016 | I highly recommend the just out book - THE FIELD OF FIGHT - by General Michael Flynn. How to defeat radical Islam.
Sat Jul 23 03:23:15 +0000 2016 | Is it the same Kaine that took hundreds of thousands of dollars in gifts while Governor of Virginia and didn't get indicted while Bob M did?
Fri Jul 22 23:03:19 +0000 2016 | Another attack, this time in Germany. Many killed. God bless the people of Munich.

Wed Jul 20 15:31:15 +0000 2016 | Good news is Melania's speech got more publicity than any in the history of politics especially if you believe that all press is good press!
Wed Jul 20 12:51:58 +0000 2016 | In November, I think the people of Ohio will remember that the Republicans picked Cleveland instead of going to another state. Jobs!

Tue Jul 12 17:04:19 +0000 2016 | To all the Bernie voters who want to stop bad trade deals &amp; global special interests, we welcome you with open arms. People first.
Tue Jul 12 17:03:44 +0000 2016 | Bernie sanders has abandoned his supporters by endorsing pro-war pro-TPP pro-Wall Street Crooked Hillary Clinton.
Tue Jul 12 17:01:51 +0000 2016 | Bernie Sanders endorsing Crooked Hillary Clinton is like Occupy Wall Street endorsing Goldman Sachs.
Tue Jul 12 16:45:45 +0000 2016 | #CrookedHillary is not qualified!
https://t.co/6qi7KTW43O
Tue Jul 12 13:39:56 +0000 2016 | I am somewhat surprised that Bernie Sanders was not true to himself and his supporters. They are not happy that he is selling out!
Tue Jul 12 13:36:47 +0000 2016 | Bernie Sanders, who has lost most of his leverage, has totally sold out to Crooked Hillary Clinton. He will endorse her today - fans angry!
Tue Jul 12 12:57:18 +0000 2016 | This election is a choice between law, order &amp; safety - or chaos, crime &amp; violence. I will make America safe again for everyone. #ImWithYou
Tue Jul 12 12:55:29 +0000 2016 | For too many years, our inner cities have been left behind. I am going to deliver jobs, safety and protection for those in need.
Tue Jul 12 11:58:58 +0000 2016 | Crime is out of control, and rapidly getting worse. Look what is going on in Chicago and our inner cities. Not good!

Sun Jul 10 18:58:10 +0000 2016 | I heard that the underachieving John King of @CNN on Inside Politics was one hour of lies. Happily, few people are watching - dead network!
Sun Jul 10 18:42:32 +0000 2016 | The media is so dishonest. If I make a statement, they twist it and turn it to make it sound bad or foolish.They think the public is stupid!
Sun Jul 10 18:27:58 +0000 2016 | President Obama thinks the nation is not as divided as people think. He is living in a world of the make believe!
Sun Jul 10 12:02:02 +0000 2016 | Look what is happening to our country under the WEAK leadership of Obama and people like Crooked Hillary Clinton. We are a divided nation!

Fri Jul 08 21:31:01 +0000 2016 | Isn't it sad that on a day of national tragedy Hillary Clinton is answering softball questions about her email lies on @CNN?
Fri Jul 08 14:32:15 +0000 2016 | Due to the horrific events taking place in our country, I have decided to postpone my speech on economic opportunity- today in Miami.

Wed Jul 06 14:06:38 +0000 2016 | I have over seven million hits on social media re Crooked Hillary Clinton. Check it out Sleepy Eyes, @MarkHalperin @NBCPolitics
Wed Jul 06 14:01:09 +0000 2016 | Sleepy eyes Chuck Todd, a man with so little touch for politics, is at it again.He could not have watched my standing ovation speech in N.C.
Wed Jul 06 13:24:50 +0000 2016 | Even the once great Caesars is bankrupt in A.C. Others to follow. Ask the Democrat City Council what happened to Atlantic City.
Wed Jul 06 13:12:43 +0000 2016 | Hillary Clinton should ask why the Democrat pols in Atlantic City made all the wrong moves - Convention Center, Airport - and destroyed City
Wed Jul 06 13:08:44 +0000 2016 | I made a lot of money in Atlantic City and left 7 years ago, great timing (as all know). Pols made big mistakes, now many bankruptcies.
Wed Jul 06 12:31:27 +0000 2016 | Crooked Hillary Clinton lied to the FBI and to the people of our country. She is sooooo guilty. But watch, her time will come!
Wed Jul 06 12:11:03 +0000 2016 | The rigged system may have helped Hillary Clinton escape criminal charges, but...https://t.co/KO64IAMDgj https://t.co/8CBSfNpl2l
Wed Jul 06 11:21:34 +0000 2016 | Crooked Hillary has once again been proven to be a person who is dishonest, incompetent and of very bad judgement.
Wed Jul 06 11:12:45 +0000 2016 | Crooked Hillary Clinton and her team "were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information." Not fit!
Wed Jul 06 04:36:31 +0000 2016 | Crooked Hillary Clinton is unfit to serve as President of the U.S. Her temperament is weak and her opponents are strong. BAD JUDGEMENT!
Wed Jul 06 04:30:04 +0000 2016 | I don't think the voters will forget the rigged system that allowed Crooked Hillary to get away with "murder." Come November 8, she's out!
Wed Jul 06 04:23:03 +0000 2016 | Raised a lot of money for the Republican Party. There will be a big gasp when the figures are announced in the morning. Lots of support! Win
Wed Jul 06 02:21:20 +0000 2016 | I will be interviewed by @oreillyfactor tonight on @FoxNews at 11pm. Enjoy!

Tue Jul 05 15:39:06 +0000 2016 | FBI director said Crooked Hillary compromised our national security. No charges. Wow! #RiggedSystem
Tue Jul 05 15:37:23 +0000 2016 | The system is rigged. General Petraeus got in trouble for far less. Very very unfair! As usual, bad judgment.
Tue Jul 05 12:05:46 +0000 2016 | It was great spending time with @joniernst yesterday. She has done a fantastic job for the people of Iowa and U.S. Will see her again!
Tue Jul 05 11:14:58 +0000 2016 | Taxpayers are paying a fortune for the use of Air Force One on the campaign trail by President Obama and Crooked Hillary. A total disgrace!
Mon Jul 04 22:59:46 +0000 2016 | On @FoxNews at 7:00 P.M. "Special: Meet the Trumps" Hope you enjoy!
Mon Jul 04 22:30:15 +0000 2016 | Why is President Obama allowed to use Air Force One on the campaign trail with Crooked Hillary? She is flying with him tomorrow. Who pays?
Mon Jul 04 15:34:15 +0000 2016 | With Hillary and Obama, the terrorist attacks will only get worse. Politically correct fools, won't even call it what it is - RADICAL ISLAM!
Mon Jul 04 15:26:56 +0000 2016 | Crooked Hillary Clinton is "guilty as hell" but the system is totally rigged and corrupt! Where are the 33,000 missing e-mails?
Mon Jul 04 14:25:04 +0000 2016 | The only people who are not interested in being the V.P. pick are the people who have not been asked!
Mon Jul 04 14:19:13 +0000 2016 | I look forward to meeting @joniernst today in New Jersey. She has done a great job as Senator of Iowa!
Mon Jul 04 14:11:09 +0000 2016 | Spent time with Indiana Governor Mike Pence and family yesterday. Very impressed, great people!
Mon Jul 04 13:56:34 +0000 2016 | Senator Tom Cotton was great on Meet the Press yesterday. Despite a totally one-sided interview by Chuck Todd, the end result was solid!
Mon Jul 04 13:42:16 +0000 2016 | Dishonest media is trying their absolute best to depict a star in a tweet as the Star of David rather than a Sheriff's Star, or plain star!
Mon Jul 04 13:32:35 +0000 2016 | Happy 4th of July! #Trump2016 #AmericaFirst https://t.co/Ndb3AQrLtY https://t.co/YhHyQjwJW6
Mon Jul 04 12:00:11 +0000 2016 | Crooked Hillary will NEVER be able to handle the complexities and danger of ISIS - it will just go on forever. We need change!
Mon Jul 04 11:54:40 +0000 2016 | The third mass attack (slaughter) in days by ISIS. 200 dead in Baghdad, worst in many years. We do not have leadership that can stop this!
Mon Jul 04 11:35:16 +0000 2016 | In Bangladesh, hostages were immediately killed by ISIS terrorists if they were unable to cite a verse from the Koran. 20 were killed!
Sun Jul 03 21:46:58 +0000 2016 | I believe that Crooked Hillary sent Bill to have the meeting with the U.S.A.G. So Bill is not in trouble with H except that he got caught!
Sun Jul 03 21:43:25 +0000 2016 | The SECRET meeting between Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G. in back of closed plane was heightened with FBI shouting "go away, no pictures."
Sun Jul 03 21:38:20 +0000 2016 | Does anybody really believe that Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G. talked only about "grandkids" and golf for 37 minutes in plane on tarmac?
Sun Jul 03 21:00:39 +0000 2016 | "THE SYSTEM IS RIGGED!"
Sun Jul 03 20:47:51 +0000 2016 | On Saturday a great man, Elie Wiesel, passed away.The world is a better place because of him and his belief that good can triumph over evil!
Sun Jul 03 20:20:20 +0000 2016 | Crooked Hillary Clinton knew that her husband wanted to meet with the U.S.A.G. to work out a deal. The system is totally rigged &amp; corrupt!
Sun Jul 03 20:16:23 +0000 2016 | Only a fool would believe that the meeting between Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G. was not arranged or that Crooked Hillary did not know.
Sun Jul 03 17:40:49 +0000 2016 | Just watched @meetthepress and how totally biased against me Chuck Todd, and the entire show, is against me.The good news-the people get it!
Sat Jul 02 21:13:02 +0000 2016 | It was just announced-by sources-that no charges will be brought against Crooked Hillary Clinton. Like I said, the system is totally rigged!
Sat Jul 02 20:39:39 +0000 2016 | It is impossible for the FBI not to recommend criminal charges against Hillary Clinton. What she did was wrong! What Bill did was stupid!

Fri Jul 01 12:12:48 +0000 2016 | Take a look at what happened w/ Bill Clinton. The system is totally rigged. Does anybody really believe that meeting was just a coincidence?
Fri Jul 01 12:12:06 +0000 2016 | Bill Clinton's meeting was a total secret. Nobody was to know about it but he was caught by a local reporter.
Fri Jul 01 12:11:41 +0000 2016 | As Bernie Sanders said, Hillary Clinton has bad judgement. Bill's meeting was probably initiated and demanded by Hillary!

Thu Jun 30 19:30:20 +0000 2016 | I have self funded my winning primary campaign with an approx. $50 million loan. I have totally terminated the loan!
Thu Jun 30 19:29:48 +0000 2016 | The very dishonest @NBCNews refuses to accept the fact that I have forgiven my $50 million loan to my campaign. Done deal!
Thu Jun 30 19:28:27 +0000 2016 | One of the reasons Hillary hid her emails was so the public wouldn't see how she got rich- selling out America.

Tue May 31 16:57:17 +0000 2016 | So many veterans groups are beyond happy with all of the money I raised/gave! It was my great honor - they do an amazing job.
Tue May 31 16:53:58 +0000 2016 | Just finished a press conference in Trump Tower wherein I gave information on which VETERANS groups got the $5,600,000 that I raised/gave!
Tue May 31 11:42:20 +0000 2016 | I have raised/given a tremendous amount of money to our great VETERANS, and have got nothing but bad publicity for doing so. Watch!
Tue May 31 10:48:49 +0000 2016 | So many great things happening - new poll numbers looking good! News conference at 11:00 A.M. today, Trump Tower!
Mon May 30 21:55:41 +0000 2016 | I should have easily won the Trump University case on summary judgement but have a judge, Gonzalo Curiel, who is totally biased against me.
Mon May 30 21:45:09 +0000 2016 | I have a judge in the Trump University civil case, Gonzalo Curiel (San Diego), who is very unfair. An Obama pick. Totally biased-hates Trump
Mon May 30 20:15:04 +0000 2016 | I hope everyone had a great Memorial Day!
Mon May 30 20:13:17 +0000 2016 | I would have had millions of votes more in the primaries (than Crooked Hillary) if I only had one opponent, instead of sixteen. Broke record
Mon May 30 11:26:47 +0000 2016 | Have a great Memorial Day and remember that we will soon MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Mon May 30 11:05:34 +0000 2016 | The endorsement of me by the 16,500 Border Patrol Agents was the first time that they ever endorsed a presidential candidate. Nice!
Mon May 30 11:00:47 +0000 2016 | In getting the endorsement of the 16,500 Border Patrol Agents (thank you), the statement was made that the WALL was very necessary!
Mon May 30 10:41:49 +0000 2016 | Obama says a WALL at our southern border won't enhance our security (wrong) and yet he now wants to build a much bigger wall (fence) at W.H.
Sun May 29 23:02:01 +0000 2016 | If dummy Bill Kristol actually does get a spoiler to run as an Independent, say good bye to the Supreme Court!
Sun May 29 22:58:27 +0000 2016 | The Republican Party has to be smart &amp; strong if it wants to win in November. Can't allow lightweights to set up a spoiler Indie candidate!
Sun May 29 22:53:16 +0000 2016 | Bill Kristol has been wrong for 2yrs-an embarrassed loser, but if the GOP can't control their own, then they are not a party. Be tough, R's!
Sun May 29 21:43:15 +0000 2016 | Good news is that my campaign has perhaps more cash than any campaign in the history of politics- b/c I stand 100% behind everything we do.
Sun May 29 16:45:44 +0000 2016 | Heading to D.C. to see and hear ROLLING THUNDER. Amazing people that LOVE OUR COUNTRY. Great spirit!
Sun May 29 11:04:47 +0000 2016 | Honor Memorial Day by thinking of and respecting all of the great men and women that gave their lives for us and our country! We love them.
Sat May 28 21:34:55 +0000 2016 | Does President Obama ever discuss the sneak attack on Pearl Harbor while he's in Japan? Thousands of American lives lost. #MDW
Sat May 28 21:33:58 +0000 2016 | Don't believe the biased and phony media quoting people who work for my campaign. The only quote that matters is a quote from me!
Sat May 28 20:28:48 +0000 2016 | I am always on the front page of the failing @nytimes, but when I won the GOP nomination, I'm in the back of the paper. Very dishonest!
Sat May 28 20:28:40 +0000 2016 | The media is on a new phony kick about my management style. I spend much less money &amp; get much better results! What we need as Prez!
Sat May 28 20:28:22 +0000 2016 | The failing @nytimes wrote a story about my management style &amp; that I don't have many people. I have 73, Hillary has 800- &amp; I'm beating her.
Sat May 28 14:47:16 +0000 2016 | I (we) broke the all-time record for most votes gotten in a Republican Primary - by a lot - and with many states left to go! Thank you.
Sat May 28 13:47:10 +0000 2016 | The U.S. has 69 treaties with other countries where we would have to defend them and their borders. How nice, but what do we get? NOT ENOUGH
Sat May 28 06:19:54 +0000 2016 | Great rally in Fresno, California- great crowd! Thank you! #Trump2016 https://t.co/TVSPvxOmve

Wed May 25 13:39:38 +0000 2016 | The protesters in New Mexico were thugs who were flying the Mexican flag. The rally inside was big and beautiful, but outside, criminals!
Wed May 25 13:14:58 +0000 2016 | Crooked Hillary Clinton just can't close the deal with Bernie. I had to knock out 16 very good and smart candidates. Hillary doesn't have it
Wed May 25 12:31:56 +0000 2016 | Goofy Senator Elizabeth Warren @elizabethforma has done less in the U.S. Senate than practically any other senator. All talk, no action!
Wed May 25 12:17:40 +0000 2016 | @elizabethforma  Goofy Elizabeth Warren, sometimes known as Pocahontas, bought foreclosed housing and made a quick killing. Total hypocrite!

Tue May 24 11:42:35 +0000 2016 | Crooked Hillary Clinton overregulates, overtaxes and doesn't care about jobs. Most importantly, she suffers from plain old bad judgement!
Tue May 24 10:41:44 +0000 2016 | I just released my financial disclosure forms, the largest numbers in the history of the F.E.C. Even the dishonest media thinks great!
Tue May 24 02:50:48 +0000 2016 | Amazingly, with all of the money I have raised for the vets, I have got nothing but bad publicity from the dishonest and disgusting media.
Tue May 24 02:46:08 +0000 2016 | Much of the money I have raised for our veterans has already been distributed, with the rest to go shortly to various other veteran groups.
Tue May 24 02:38:48 +0000 2016 | While under no obligation to do so, I have raised between 5 &amp; 6 million dollars, including 1million dollars from me, for our VETERANS. Nice!

Sun May 22 03:55:39 +0000 2016 | Crooked Hillary said that I  want guns brought into the school classroom. Wrong!

Sat May 21 12:49:59 +0000 2016 | Crooked Hillary wants to get rid of all guns and yet she is surrounded by bodyguards who are fully armed. No more guns to protect Hillary!
Sat May 21 10:56:20 +0000 2016 | While our wonderful president was out playing golf all day, the TSA is falling apart, just like our government! Airports a total disaster!

Fri May 20 10:08:49 +0000 2016 | Crooked Hillary Clinton looks presidential? I don't think so! Four more years of Obama and our country will never come back. ISIS LAUGHS!

Fri May 20 09:47:09 +0000 2016 | Crooked Hillary has zero imagination and even less stamina. ISIS, China, Russia and all would love for her to be president. 4 more years!

Sat May 07 02:44:54 +0000 2016 | Goofy Elizabeth Warren is weak and ineffective. Does nothing. All talk, no action -- maybe her Native American name?
Sat May 07 02:44:44 +0000 2016 | Goofy Elizabeth Warren and her phony Native American heritage are on a Twitter rant. She is too easy! I'm driving her nuts.
Sat May 07 00:16:31 +0000 2016 | Crooked Hillary Clinton wants completely open borders. Millions of Democrats will run from her over this and support me.
Sat May 07 00:14:54 +0000 2016 | Just met with courageous family of Sarah Root in Nebraska. Sarah was horribly killed by illegal immigrant, but leaves behind amazing legacy.
Fri May 06 23:16:36 +0000 2016 | Goofy Elizabeth Warren, Hillary Clinton‚Äôs flunky, has a career that is totally based on a lie. She is not Native American.
Fri May 06 23:16:17 +0000 2016 | Let‚Äôs properly check goofy Elizabeth Warren‚Äôs records to see if she is Native American. I say she‚Äôs a fraud!
Fri May 06 23:15:58 +0000 2016 | I hope corrupt Hillary Clinton chooses goofy Elizabeth Warren as her running mate. I will defeat them both.

Fri May 06 18:25:27 +0000 2016 | I hear @JoeNBC of rapidly fading @Morning_Joe is pushing hard for a third party candidate to run. This will guarantee a Crooked Hillary win.
Fri May 06 18:03:34 +0000 2016 | Joe Scarborough initially endorsed Jeb Bush and Jeb crashed, then John Kasich and that didn't work. Not much power or insight!
Fri May 06 16:08:23 +0000 2016 | Thank you to teachers across America! When I become POTUS we will make education a far more important component of our life than it is now.
Fri May 06 12:38:38 +0000 2016 | Crooked Hillary has ZERO leadership ability. As Bernie Sanders says, she has bad judgement. Constantly playing the women's card - it is sad!
Fri May 06 12:08:37 +0000 2016 | Paul Ryan said that I inherited something very special, the Republican Party. Wrong, I didn't inherit it, I won it with millions of voters!
Fri May 06 11:50:19 +0000 2016 | "@Ausbiz:  Many would say that you are the only talented person running for the top job this time! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #TrumpTrain"
Fri May 06 10:26:43 +0000 2016 | So many great endorsements yesterday, except for Paul Ryan! We must put America first and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Fri May 06 10:19:08 +0000 2016 | Governor Rick Perry said "Donald Trump is one of the most talented people running for the Presidency I've ever seen." Thank you Rick!
Fri May 06 10:14:56 +0000 2016 | Unlike crooked Hillary Clinton, who wants to destroy all miners, I want wages to go up in America. We will do so by bringing back jobs!
Fri May 06 03:19:09 +0000 2016 | Thank you West Virginia. Let's keep it going. Go out and vote on Tuesday - we will win big. #Trump2016
Fri May 06 01:57:05 +0000 2016 | Can you believe Crooked Hillary said, "We are going to put a whole lot of coal miners&amp;coal companies out of business." She then apologized.

Tue May 03 23:02:55 +0000 2016 | Wow, Lyin' Ted Cruz really went wacko today. Made all sorts of crazy charges. Can't function under pressure - not very presidential. Sad!

Mon Apr 25 11:54:21 +0000 2016 | Lyin' Ted Cruz and 1 for 38 Kasich are unable to beat me on their own so they have to team up (collusion) in a two on one. Shows weakness!

Thu Apr 21 22:16:27 +0000 2016 | Cruz said Kasich should leave because he couldn't get to 1237. Now he can't get to 1237. Drop out LYIN' Ted.
Thu Apr 21 21:47:21 +0000 2016 | Both Ted Cruz and John Kasich have no path to victory. They should both drop out of the race so that the Republican Party can unify!
Thu Apr 21 10:22:03 +0000 2016 | Senator Ted Cruz has been MATHEMATICALLY ELIMINATED from race. He said Kasich should get out for same reason. I think both should get out!

Sun Apr 17 13:38:31 +0000 2016 | Lyin' Ted Cruz can't get votes (I am millions ahead of him) so he has to get his delegates from the Republican bosses. It won't work!
Sun Apr 17 13:34:25 +0000 2016 | Lyin' Ted Cruz will never be able to beat Hillary. Despite a rigged delegate system, I am hundreds of delegates ahead of him.
